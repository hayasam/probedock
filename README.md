Probe Dock tracks the tests in your projects to show you the evolution of your test coverage and analyze the health of your projects.

It has two main components: the Probe Dock server and probes.
Probes hook into your favorite test framework and publish the test results to Probe Dock for analysis.
Probe Dock generates test run reports and day-to-day metrics on your tests.
